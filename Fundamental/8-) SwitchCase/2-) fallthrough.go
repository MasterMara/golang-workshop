/*Some Notes By Mustafa KARACABEY:

1-) Third case is wrong  normally does not run. With fallthrough third case is running.
2-) after fallthrough there is no coming anything. Fallthrough is final.
3-) fallthrough will execute the body of the next case, no checking that next case for a match!, you should explicitly mention fallthrough.
4-) Fallthroug is some kind of finally in c sharp
