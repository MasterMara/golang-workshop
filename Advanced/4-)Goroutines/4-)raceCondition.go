/*Some Notes By Mustafa KARACABEY:
1-)  Some NOtesIf you run this code, this will not result in a crash,
2-) If you run the code with the built-in race condition checker, the go compiler will complain about the problem. go run -race .
3-) A race condition in Go occurs when two or more goroutines have shared data and interact with it simultaneously.
This is best explained with the help of an example
4-) Occurs when 2 values want to reach memory at the same time
5-) When Multiple Treads try to access and modify same data it will occur race condition.
